## Background

Dr Ben Goldacre created the original Nerdy Day Trips in 2011 as a crowd-sourced Google Maps frontend. Through it, people could find and share science museums, historical sites, observatories, and other interesting destinations worldwide.

When the original site went offline in 2016, much of the community's contributed data was lost. This project rebuilds and improves on that concept using modern, sustainable technology.
