# About Nerdy Day Trips

Welcome to Nerdy Day Trips – your guide to fascinating destinations around the world! We're building a global community-driven map of places that spark curiosity and wonder: science museums, observatories, maker spaces, historical sites, research facilities, and hidden gems that make learning an adventure.

## Our Mission

We believe that curiosity is universal, and amazing places to learn and explore exist everywhere. Our goal is to create the most comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date map of intellectually stimulating destinations worldwide. Whether you're a student, educator, lifelong learner, or just someone who loves discovering cool stuff, we want to help you find your next great adventure.

## The Story Behind the Reboot

The original Nerdy Day Trips was ahead of its time. Created by Dr Ben Goldacre in 2011, it was a pioneering crowd-sourced platform where people could discover and share amazing nerdy destinations. The site featured an interactive Google Map dotted with pins representing everything from particle accelerators you could visit to quirky local science museums.

For five wonderful years, the community grew and contributed hundreds of locations. Then, in 2016, the site went offline, and much of that collective knowledge was lost to time.

We couldn't let that happen again.

## Building Something Better

This modern reboot preserves the original spirit while embracing open-source principles and sustainable technology. Every location, every piece of data, and even the website code itself is openly available. We've learned from the past to build something more resilient and community-owned.

Our platform is designed to grow with the community, making it easy for anyone to contribute while ensuring the data remains accessible to everyone forever.

## How We Work

Behind the scenes, we use modern web technologies to create a fast, reliable experience. But what makes us special isn't the tech – it's the community. Every pin on our map represents someone's discovery, someone's passion for sharing knowledge and wonder with others.

We're still growing and improving. There are exciting features in development, design improvements being made, and most importantly, amazing new places being added every day.

## Join Our Community

This project succeeds because of people like you. Whether you're contributing locations, fixing data, improving code, or simply exploring and sharing what you find, you're part of building something special.

Together, we're creating a resource that celebrates curiosity, learning, and the joy of discovery. Every place we add is another opportunity for someone to have their mind blown, learn something new, or find their next passion.

## Acknowledgments

We stand on the shoulders of giants. Immense gratitude goes to Dr Ben Goldacre for his original vision, the developers at Applecado and Aaron Rudd who built the original platform, and Jo Brodie whose writing inspired the whole concept. Most importantly, we honor all the original contributors who shared their favorite places – this reboot exists to continue their legacy.
