# About Nerdy Day Trips

Nerdy Day Trips aims to create a global map of places to visit that might appeal to nerdy types. The open source data is crowd-sourced in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yourusername/nerdydaytrips). The website is regularly built using this data.

## History

Originally **Nerdy Day Trips** (at `nerdydaytrips.com`) was a website creation of Dr Ben Goldacre in 2011. It was a crowd-sourced database of "nerdy" places to go. The site was built as a frontend to an editable Google Map.

Upon visiting the site, users would see a large Google Map with pins dotted around the world, indicating the locations of "nerdy" places. Visitors could navigate around the map, and click the pins to get details about each location. The data was crowd-sourced, so anyone could add nerdy places to the database.

The website went down in 2016. There are some captures of the data on the Internet Archive, but the dataset there is incomplete.

## The Reboot

This site serves as a spiritual successor and reboot of the original Nerdy Day Trips concept. We've modernized the technology stack and made the data fully open-source. The project is maintained by a small group of enthusiasts who believe in sharing information about interesting places.

## How it works

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and features:

- An interactive map powered by Leaflet.js
- Open-source data in markdown format
- A blog with posts about selected locations
- Regular updates as new locations are added
