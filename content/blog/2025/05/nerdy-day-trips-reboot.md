# Turning if off and on again

This is a bit of an experiment. For *years* now I've chatted with friends about rebooting the old "Nerdy Day Trips" site that Ben Goldacre bootstrapped 'back in the day'.

Stuart did sterling work some years back to extract "legacy" data from the Internet Archive. 

I finally found some spare (lol) time to smash some bits togethe. This is the *somewhat* janky result.

It's "powered" by [Hugo]((https://github.com/gohugoio)), a static site generator. 

Quick fire points:

* The old site went down, and there seems to have been no backup or repo that I could see.
* We scraped some date from the Internet Archive to see if it could be brought back to life - there's some data, but not a lot.
* Adding and modifying entries (currently) requires a GitHub account.
* *handwave* in the future you'll be able to add/modify via a web form, maybe, if we can combat the spam (lol).
* The goal is to add nerdy places to the site, while keeping the data open.
* Yes, it's ugly. I am terribad at CSS.

"Patches welcome."
