# Back online

After years of "we should really bring back Nerdy Day Trips" conversations, we've actually done it. The beloved crowd-sourced map of fascinating places to visit is back, rebuilt from the ground up.

For those who remember the original site, this should feel familiar. For newcomers, you're looking at a global map of intellectually interesting destinations - science museums, observatories, maker spaces, research facilities, and other places worth visiting if you're curious about the world.

## What we've built

The new site runs on Hugo, a static site generator, which means it's fast, reliable, and won't disappear overnight like the original did. We've designed everything to be open-source and community-owned, learning from what happened before.

Stuart's work recovering data from the Internet Archive gave us a foundation to build on, and we've made sure all the code and data is openly available.

## Where we are

Here's what works:

* **The concept is rescued**: The original went offline in 2016, but the idea was too good to leave dead
* **Data recovery**: We've salvaged what we could from archives and are rebuilding the database
* **Modern foundation**: Everything is version-controlled, open-source, and built to last
* **Community focus**: Every decision prioritizes sustainability and community ownership
* **Open data**: All location information remains freely accessible

## What's next

The core functionality works well, but there's more to build:

* **Easier submissions**: Adding locations currently requires GitHub knowledge, but we're planning web forms
* **Design improvements**: The site works but could look better
* **Mobile optimization**: Making it work smoothly on phones
* **Community features**: Ways for people to connect and share experiences

## How to help

This succeeds through community contributions:

**Add places**: Know an interesting observatory, quirky museum, or hidden scientific gem? Add it to the map.

**Spread the word**: Tell other curious people about the site.

**Contribute skills**: Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or just have good ideas, there's probably something you can help with.

**Join the conversation**: Connect with us on social media and help shape what we build next.

## Why we're doing this

We believe in curiosity and community. Every location on the map represents someone's enthusiasm for sharing interesting places with others. We're building something that celebrates the joy of discovery and makes it easier for curious people to find their next adventure.

The original Nerdy Day Trips inspired countless visits and learning experiences. This reboot continues that legacy while ensuring it can survive long-term.
