Hello Day Trippers!

Just a quick note to mention that [popey](https://popey.me) (one of the maintainers of this website) briefly talked about the site origin story and setup on [Linux Matters Podcast](https://linuxmatters.sh), [episode 57](https://linuxmatters.sh/57/).

The segment is in the middle, from 13m12s to 24m26s, sandwiched between Martin's GitHub topic, and Mark's bit about playing Avowed on the Steam Deck. It's not too Linuxy, honest!
