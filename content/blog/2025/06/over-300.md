This [NerdyDayTrips](https://nerdydaytrips.org) 'reboot' has only been live for a couple of weeks, without too much fanfare. However, we've seen plenty of activity in that time. As mentioned above, we've had **over 300** new venues added, **over 100** edits, 30 deletions and a bunch of minor code edits. Thank you to everyone who has contributed so far.

Looking at the summary of activity (below) so far, clearly 29th May was the busiest day (for additions) we have had. There's also been quite a bit of venue data clean-up across both the mass-imported, and new venue submissions. Thanks to Hugo for leading that charge!

Here's some numbers:
