Spread across 50000 sq feet, 3 floors, and 9 exhibit galleries, IME is India’s first interactive music museum. India is a vast country and its diversity in the form of art and culture depicts the love and respect for it. Music in India is as old as anyone can remember it. With a deep R & D of nearly 10 years, IME was constructed with a vision to introduce the youth to the diversity of Indian Music and to preserve India’s rich musical heritage. Indian Music Experience Museum is an experience of its kind.
The 9 exhibit galleries illustrate various styles of music ranging from traditional to folk, pop, Bollywood, and contemporary. Very artistically and tastefully designed galleries allow you to explore stories about various songs and music in each genre through computerized audio-visual touch screens. Varieties of musical instruments and artefacts on display make the whole ambiance very calming.
