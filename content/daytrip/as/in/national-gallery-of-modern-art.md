The National Gallery of Modern Art, Bengaluru was set up in the premises of the Manikyavelu Mansion at 49 Palace Road, Bangalore and opened to the public on 18th February, 2009. Spread over an area of 3.5 acres, the gracious heritage building was transformed from a residence into an Art Gallery, with a display space of 1551 square meters to which a new gallery block with a display space of 1260 sq. m. was added. The architecture of the additional block was designed in such a fashion that it merges with the style and ambience of the heritage Manikyavelu Mansion while at the same time fulfilling the requirements of a modern museum.
