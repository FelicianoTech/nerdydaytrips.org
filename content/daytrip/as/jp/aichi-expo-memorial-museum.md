Part of the legacy of the 2005 Expo. The small free museum houses a collection of artifacts donated by the exhibiting countries, and displays about the expo itself. There are also some robot/animatronics that were used. It is housed in what used to be the suites for visiting dignitaries. 
Oddly for something from 2005 it has a very 60s futurist feel to the design. 

You can get to the park on the Linimo maglev, another legacy of the Expo. 
The Ghibli museum is also hosted in the park and there are many Ghibli items to discover in the public areas.
