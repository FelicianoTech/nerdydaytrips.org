Why not visit the (approximate) birthplace of the Japanese instant noodle, visit a wonderful area with lots of history, and come out with your own custom made instant noodle (which can be turned into an adorable floating balloon in the end) ðŸ˜› Lots of quirky and authentic instant noodles that are harder to get out of the region for purchase for souvenirs as well.
