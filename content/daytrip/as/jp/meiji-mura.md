An open air architectural park North East of Nagoya comprised of buildings relocated from all over Japan. The Meiji period is roughly comparable to Victorian and was the era when Japan opened to the West. 
Notable buildings are Lafcadio Hearne's house and Natsume Soseki's house. There is also an early wooden Japanese prison. Most famous is the Lobby and Entrance of Frank Lloyd Wright's Tokyo Imperial Hotel. 
The park can be access by bus from Inuyama, itself a short train ride from Nagoya.
