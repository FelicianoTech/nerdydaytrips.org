The restored pre dreadnaught ship used as Admiral Togo's flagship at the battle of Tsushima when Japan defeated the Russian fleet in 1905. 
Sadly encased in concrete and stripped of many fittings at the insistence of the occupying powers post ww2, you'd wonder how much of Ship of Theseus is going on. Nevertheless it is an important historical ship and now unique. 
Situated in Yokosuka. Where the US Navy has a huge base and you can also see JSDF vessels in the bay.
