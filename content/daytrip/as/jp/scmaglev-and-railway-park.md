Everything you might want to know about shinkansen (bullet trains) and the new maglev train. They have everything from the test model of the maglev to early rolling stock built in the UK. There is also a chance to try a driving simulator, however places are allocated through a lottery system using your entrance ticket. 
Access is via the Aonami Line from Nagoya JR station.
