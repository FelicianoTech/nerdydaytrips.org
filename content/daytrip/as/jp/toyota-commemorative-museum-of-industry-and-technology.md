A museum on the site where the Toyota company was founded. It goes from the company's beginnings as a loom and textile company through the the present day as a manufacturer of electric vehicles. 
Interesting highlights for me were: a jacquard loom; robot musicians; a humongous hydraulic press that you can 'operate' with the press of a button; a recreation of a robotic assembly line; Toyota's first truck and car. 
It is resonably close to JR Nagoya station.
