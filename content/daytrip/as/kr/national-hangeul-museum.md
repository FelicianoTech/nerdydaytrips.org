One of Korea's proudest cultural achievements is Hangeul, the 24-letter alphabet used to write the Korean language.  Prior to its invention in 1443, there simply was no Korean written language.

This museum is devoted to Hangeul and its invention.  Most notable in the collection is a rare surviving copy of Hunmin Jeongeum, the original user's guide for Hangeul.
