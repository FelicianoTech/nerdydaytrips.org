Tukht-e-Babri.jpg Lying 30 miles southwest of Chakwal on the Chakwal-Sargodha road, Kallar Kahar is known for its peacocks, for its freshwater lake, and for the Takht-e-Babri, a flat stage built of stone by emperor Babar to address his army while coming down from Kabul in the quest of the crown of Delhi. During his stay at Kallar Kahar, Babar also planted a garden, which still exists, called the Bagh-e-Safa. In his memoirs, the Tukht-e-Babri, Babar described Kallar Kahar as a "charming place with good air" and natural beauty.
