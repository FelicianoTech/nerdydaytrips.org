There's a ton of permanent transport, industry and tech exhibits there, plus changing exhibitions, often about currently very relevant topics.

I personally love the collection of household devices, and I enjoy looking at the fridge-sized CPU. I usually stop by the trains, and visit the rescue helicopter on the top floor.
