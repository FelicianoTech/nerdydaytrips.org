Vintage technology museum with lots of old computers, radios and other telecom equipment. This is also the venue for other nerdy events such as the Swiss Maker Faire (makerfaire.ch), Vintage Computer Festival (vintagecomputerfestival.ch), Nerdy Flohmarkt (nerdyflohmarkt.ch), Filmautotreffen (moviecars.ch), SoloCon (solocon.ch).

Personal note: I attended SoloCon 2025 and the one-day ticket included free roaming around the whole museum, even though it was actually a bit cheaper than the normal museum one-day ticket, and it was wonderful!
