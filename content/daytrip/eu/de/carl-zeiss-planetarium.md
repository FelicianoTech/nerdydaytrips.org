The digital 360° full-dome projection system with nine high-performance projectors enables impressive forms of scientific presentation in the planetarium.Flights through the depths of space can be impressively displayed on the basis of huge databases, planets, galaxies, space probes and many other celestial bodies can be shown in great detail. Even journeys through the human body are possible and natural phenomena can be shown realistically.
