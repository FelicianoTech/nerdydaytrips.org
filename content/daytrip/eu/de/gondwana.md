        Amazing Dinosaur Museum! Animatronic dinosaurs and realistic prehistoric rooms. The target audience is kids, but as an adult I was more giddy and excited by this place than half the kids. It's so detailed and there's tons of neat fossils. A complete Brontosaurus skeleton is in the lobby. Breath-taking!
