Lorch Monastery, established 900 years ago by the House of Staufen, serves as a significant historical site located in the Rems river valley. Originally intended as a burial place for the Staufen family, the Benedictine monastery was lavishly endowed and became a prominent landmark. The Romanesque structure featured two towering church spires, symbolizing its royal origins, and was designed in the shape of a cross, incorporating essential buildings like a cloister and farmyard. 

In the late Middle Ages, the monastery experienced a revival, characterized by the addition of a late Gothic rib vault and ornate decor, just before the Reformation led to its dissolution in the 16th century, transforming it into a Protestant site. Despite its decline, the legacy of the House of Staufen persisted, and efforts were made to preserve the monastery church as it fell into disrepair. Today, Lorch Monastery has been revitalized and offers unique tours, allowing visitors to appreciate its rich history and stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The site stands as a testament to the enduring heritage of the Staufen family.
