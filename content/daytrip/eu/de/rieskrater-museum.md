The RiesCraterMuseum is a natural science museum with the central theme of the formation and significance of impact craters and the crater “Nördlinger Ries” in particular. In an elaborately renovated medieval barn building dating back to 1503, the Ries event with its planetological roots and its earthly effects, which continue to have an impact to this day, is presented in six rooms.
