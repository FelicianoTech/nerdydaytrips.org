Check out Europe's biggest hole and see Bagger 288's first workplace for yourself!

It's outside, only makes sense with good weather and no fog. Bring binoculars or your telephoto camera.

Not wheelchair accessible, but there is another viewpoint at the opposite side without steps (i think).

A bit to the south you will find an abandoned piece of motorway.
