Old cold war allied listening station. The station was used to monitor Soviet and Eastern Bloc communications and gather important information on the activities of Warsaw Pact countries. After being decommissioned in 1992, the site lays empty for years. It is now a gallery for street art, and the buildings have been granted monumental status.
