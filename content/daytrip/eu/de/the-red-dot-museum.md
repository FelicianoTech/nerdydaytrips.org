Houses a collection of Red Dot design award-winning items from multiple countries: beautiful and practical consumer and professional things, many of which you can grab and interact with. It's located inside a former industrial coal processing plant. Very photogenic, and the staff is very nice. Also, decently prized. Great place for lovers of good product design.
