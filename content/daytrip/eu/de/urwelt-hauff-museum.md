Immerse yourself in Holzmaden's unique witnesses to evolution - its extraordinary fossils - giving you an unrivalled insight into the mysteries of the prehistoric world 180 million years ago.

The Urwelt-Museum Hauff, with its renowned Posidonia shale fossils, is in the world-famous Holzmaden/Ohmden fossil site. Today, it’s a private museum run by the fourth generation of the Hauff family. Under scientific supervision, the palaeontological preparators uncover fossil treasures such as ichthyosaurs, crocodiles and crinoids from the Posidonia shale. The Hauff Museum is one of the largest private natural history museums in Germany, with an exhibition area of around 1000 square metres.
