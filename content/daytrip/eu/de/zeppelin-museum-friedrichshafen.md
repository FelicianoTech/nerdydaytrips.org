The Zeppelin Museum, which owes its name to the airships developed by Count Zeppelin on Lake Constance, is particularly dedicated to innovative processes in technology, art and society. With permanent and temporary exhibitions and accompanying events, they build a bridge between the humanities and natural sciences and relate them to current social discourses. As an interdisciplinary museum for technology and art, the Hafenbahnhof not only houses the world's largest and most important collection on the history of airship travel, but also an art collection with extensive holdings by Otto Dix, Marta Hoepffner and Andreas Feininger.
