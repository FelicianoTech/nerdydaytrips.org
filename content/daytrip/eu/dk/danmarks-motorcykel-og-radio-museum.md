Motorcycle and Radio Museum
You can experience Northern Europe's largest collection of vintage motorcycles. The exhibition begins with the early days of the motorcycle in the late 1800s and takes you through the 20th century, including the world wars and the rock icons of the 1960s, all the way to the arrival of fast Japanese machines in the 1980s. There are more than 200 motorcycles on display – including 11 Danish models. The exhibition is for children and adults of all ages.

The radio section offers insight into the development of electronics throughout the 20th century – for example, you can see a specimen of the world’s first loudspeaker – the Magnavox.
