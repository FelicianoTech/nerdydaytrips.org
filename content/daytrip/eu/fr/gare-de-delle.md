French railway station that is not connected to the French rail network! It is currently connected to the Swiss rail network &amp; served by trains from Dellemont. The line originally ran from Belfort in France to Govelier in Switzerland but the line was cut back to Boncourt in Switzerland. As part of an EU project the line was re-opened from Boncourt to Delle in 2006 with the intention of re-opening the line to Belfort on the French national rail network.
