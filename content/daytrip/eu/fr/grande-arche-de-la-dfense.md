A monumental building, designed to complement the Arc de Triomphe, and to cap the end of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées from the Louvre to La Défense. The building is skewed off the line of the avenue by a few degrees, to match the angle of the Arc de Triomphe.

There is a rooftop terrace and restaurant, from which you can see spectacular views of Paris, and the ruler-straight route back down to the pyramid at the entrance to the Louvre.
