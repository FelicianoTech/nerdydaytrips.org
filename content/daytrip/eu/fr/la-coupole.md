Did you know that the German military attempted build a Tracy Island-style rocket launch base just north of Paris? Had it ever gone in to operation it would have bombarded London with a constant stream of V2 rockets 24/7. Thankfully the war ended before then, but construction was nearly complete and it is now a museum and holocaust memorial centre. An incredible concrete dome embedded in a hill.
