Fantastic space and aviation museum packed with rockets and aircraft. Highlights include the last Concorde capable of flying (it hasn't been fully decommissioned and still gets powered up occasionally) and a Boeing 747 – both of which you can board – some of the amazing experimental aircraft produced by the French aerospace industry in the post-war years and the Rocket/Space hall. Only a short bus or train ride from downtown Paris
