The site of the [Battle of Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings) in 1066. Coincidentally, this happened in the town of [Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle,_East_Sussex) ;-)

Visit the [Battle Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Abbey) and go for a tour of the battlefield.
