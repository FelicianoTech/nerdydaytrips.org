In the 1930s, the pretty village of Avebury, partially encompassed by the stone circle of this World Heritage Site, was witness to the excavations of archaeologist Alexander Keiller. Keiller opened the museum here to display his findings in 1938 in the old stable building of Avebury Manor where he lived.

In re-erecting many of the stones, Keiller uncovered the true wonder of one of the most important megalithic monuments in Europe. You can see his fascinating finds on display in the museum, still housed in the stables but now also in the 17th-century threshing barn, where interactive displays and activities for children bring the landscape to life.

Avebury Manor has just reopened following a major transformation for a new BBC series entitled The Manor Reborn.
