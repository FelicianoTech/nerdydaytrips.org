The final resting place of XL426, the RAF's second to last AVRO Vulcan nuclear bomber (their last being XH558)... The engineering team keeping the aircraft alive seem to be around most Saturdays, and if you check their website (www.avrovulcan.com) they have open days... There is also a pub next to it :)
