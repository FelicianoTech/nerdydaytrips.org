Named Battery Point after the batteries of guns which have been stationed here during most major conflicts since the English Civil War, this is a view point worth visiting for it's views of the south Wales hills and the odd reminant of aforementioned batteries. Adjacent to Portishead's crowning glory, the Lake Grounds Park which is worth a visit too. Not a great deal to do here but peaceful if a tad windswept. Battery Point is also where most of Portishead's youth have had their 1st drink of fermented apple juice.
