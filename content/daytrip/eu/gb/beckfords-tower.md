Tower with a museum about William Beckford and fantastic views over Bath.

        If it is a particularly windy day take a kite, the playing fields on the hill next to the tower are perfect. 

It's also worth asking the guides inside the tower about Beckford, they have a lot of really interesting history about him!!
