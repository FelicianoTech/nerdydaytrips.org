The Grade II* listed landmark is the longest-surviving Victorian wrought-iron viaduct in the UK. The viaduct was built by the Great Northern Railway and opened in 1878.

Now a foot and cycle bridge. Straddling the Nottinghamshire-Derbyshire border and standing 20 metres above the valley of the River Erewash, it is over 400 metres long.
