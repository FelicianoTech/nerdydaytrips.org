Bugsworth Basin was the largest and busiest inland port on Britain's narrow canal system and the only one to survive intact. It was restored over three decades and makes for a great visit. There is also the remains of the Peak Forest Tramway which connected the Basin to local quarries. I definitely recommend visiting the Navigation Inn near the point.
