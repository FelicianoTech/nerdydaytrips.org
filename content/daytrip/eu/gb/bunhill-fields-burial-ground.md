Discovered after listening to the TheThe song 'Some Days I Drink My Coffee by the Grave of William Blake' and a detour on a cycle ride. It contains the graves of many non-conformists, including the aforementioned William Blake, but also of Thomas Bayes, statistician and Bayesian probability fame amongst many others. They're are two graves for William Blake and the story behind that is an interesting one:https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/11/how-amateur-sleuths-finally-tracked-down-burial-place-william-blake
