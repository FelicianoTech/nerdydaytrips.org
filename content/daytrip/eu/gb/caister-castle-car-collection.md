Do you like castles and cars? Well, you're in luck here! On the same site, you can visit the ruins of a 400+ year-old Caister Castle and one of the largest privately held car collections in the UK.

There isn't much of the castle left, but there is a tower to climb. This is compensated by a huge collection of cars, motorcycles, and quirky vehicles. There are guides all through the museum, ready to tell the stories of each car. It is worth a visit.
