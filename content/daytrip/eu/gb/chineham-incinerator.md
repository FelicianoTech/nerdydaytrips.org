My Wife suggested visiting an incinerator - I thought she was mad! But Chineham Wonder Day was brilliant. Best bit: operating a massive grab moving tonnes of waste via joystick in the control room. Educational without being preachy, showing how rubbish becomes electricity. Heavy machinery + learning = perfect nerdy day out.
