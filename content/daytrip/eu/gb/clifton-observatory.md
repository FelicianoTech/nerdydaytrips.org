A camera obscura with views across the Bristol skyline, built in the tower of the old Bristol Observatory. Has displays of the history of the observatory, and a rooftop cafe with a spectacular view over Bristol and the Clifton Suspension Bridge.

Also the entrance to Ghyston's Cave, which opens in the side of the Avon gorge, giving a lower view of the suspension bridge and gorge.
