Compton Verney is a neoclassical mansion set in 120 acres of Capability Brown-designed parkland in Warwickshire, now home to an internationally acclaimed art gallery featuring diverse collections from Chinese bronzes to British folk art.

The folk art exhibitions are fantastic and well worth a look; in addition, they have temporary exhibitions, peaceful lakeside walks and elegant Georgian architecture. Whether you're an art enthusiast or simply seeking a tranquil escape in the English countryside it's a great day out!
