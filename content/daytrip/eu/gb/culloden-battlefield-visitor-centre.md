Scene of the catastrophic last stand of the Jacobite rebellion against the Government forces, Culloden is the site of the last pitched battle to be fought on British soil. Forced to come to arms in poor order, following a botched night raid, in around an hour the ambition to restore a Stuart monarch to the throne was smashed for ever and Bonnie Prince Charlie was in flight to exile.

The visitor centre and battlefield are maintained by the National Trust for Scotland. There is a small museum/exhibition and cafe. A good portion of the battlefield can be walked, with markers of the Government and Jacobite lines. The mass graves of the fallen rebel soldiers are also marked.
