One of the oldest permenant seismic observatories in the world, Comrie has had an earthquake observatory since 1840 due to the relatively high number of seismic events it has for a UK site, hence it's nickname - Shaky Toun.

The restored Earthquake House out at The Ross has large windows so visitors can look in at the equipment.
