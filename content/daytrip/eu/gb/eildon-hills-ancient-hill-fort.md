We are told that these hills were fortified around 1000BC in the Bronze age. The hills are rather unique in that respect - many still visible platforms were carved out of the hills to provide foundations for homes and fortifications. 

Wear some sturdy boots and get up there for an afternoon. You will be rewarded with great views of the Cheviots and the English border to the South and the Lammermuirs to the North, plus aerial views of Bowden, Melrose and St Boswells.

The Romans were also up here and there remains the footprint of a big fort down at 'Trimontium'. Well worth a visit. Also the Roman road 'Dere Street' which leads south and through the Cheviots where it passes a Roman staging post, which is an amazing example of a four cornered fort with ramparts and gates etc, all visible in the undisturbed soil formations.
