The natural area is beautiful - but the built environment is too - dams and reservoirs, built to supply Birmingham with water. In 1904 the

Elan Valley dams were completed and "opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra". Unconvinced by the verb 'opened'..... Still, a good nerdy day trip.

Get a map. Walk about. Go home. Sorted
