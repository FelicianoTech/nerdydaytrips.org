Fizzpop makerspace is run on a non-profit basis to serve the creative interests of members and non-members alike. Whether youâ€™re interested in crafting, electronics, woodwork, metalwork, knitting, sewing, programming, prototyping,  robotics, or nearly anything else.

Most Wednesdays there is a public night where anyone can have a tour and chat to like minded nerdy people.
