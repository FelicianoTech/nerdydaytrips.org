Former pottery factory turned into a museum. It has several bottle kilns, demonstrations, and the opportunity for guests to try throwing a pot and making a clay flower. There is a large display of toilets from the very early models to current ones. The museum hosts the Channel 4 programme The Great Pottery Throwdown.
