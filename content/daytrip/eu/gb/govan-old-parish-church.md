Home of the Govan Stones, a collection of monumental relics from the medieval Kingdom of Strathclyde (or Alt Clut) which once dominated west-central Scotland, the Borders, Cumbria and parts of Northumberland. The centre of this great North-Welsh civilisation moved upstream from the fortress on Dumbarton Rock to a base which was less easy to encircle at Govan. The impressive 9th Century carvings reflect the power and influence of this almost-forgotten kingdom at one of the most ancient Christian sites in the British Isles. The stones have been brought indoors from the kirkyard and the site has been rescued and maintained by the hard work of Govan Heritage Trust. A visit and a donation will be greatly appreciated.
