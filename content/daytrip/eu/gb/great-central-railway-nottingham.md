A preserved section of the Great Central Railway between Ruddington and  Loughborough, with work ongoing to restore the link to the Great Central Railway. This will extend the line to Leicester, creating a 29 km heritage railway. The Ruddington site is also home to the Model Railway Club, Classic Bus Collection, and a Ride-on Miniature Railway.
