Hengoed Viaduct is a disused railway viaduct located above the village of Maesycwmmer, in Caerphilly county borough, South Wales. Grade II* listed, it was originally built to carry the Taff Vale Extension of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NA&HR) across the Rhymney River, and is now part of National Cycle Route 47.

At its eastern end to the "Wheel o Drams" sculpture, a ~20m vertical circle of coal railway trucks, formerly commonplace in these South Wales valleys.
