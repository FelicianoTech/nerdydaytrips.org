The first pier here was constructed in 1831, the current structure was completed in 1899 and at 1,154 m was the second longest pier in the world after Southend Pier. The majority of the pier was destroyed and dismantled from 1978-1980 due to storm damage and general neglect, and all that remains is the detached pierhead and a stub of the pier that housed a sports centre until 2011.
