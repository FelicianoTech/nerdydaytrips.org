When London got too bright in the 1950s, the Royal Observatory was moved from Greenwich to Herstmonceux in East Sussex. While no longer used for scientific observation (Eastbourne and Hailsham are now too bright), it still contains working telescopes, and a small hands-on science centre.

There is Herstmonceux Castle nearby on the same site, for those interested in the historical buildings and gardens.
