Most come here for the Needles, two rock spires off the coast, but next door to the viewpoint are what’s left of High Down Rocket Test Site.

In the 50s and 60s the UK tried to be a third contestant in the Space Race and here they tested their rockets. The Black Arrow that sent Britain's launched the UK’s one-and-only indigenous orbital mission was among them.

Only walkways and the foundations of the test stands remain, but a two-room museum is at the Needles New Battery a short walk away.
