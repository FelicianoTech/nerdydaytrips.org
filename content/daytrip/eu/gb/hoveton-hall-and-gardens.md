The beautiful Hoveton Hall Estate covers 620 acres of parkland, gardens, woodland, arable and grazing land. This fine Regency Hall was built between 1809-1812 and has been owned by the Buxton family since 1946. Handed down through the generations, the hall was passed on to Harry and Rachel Buxton in 2013. Hoveton Hall is a lived-in family home and is never empty or idle. Harry and Rachel are sharing their lovely home and the surrounding estate and welcome guests to spend a while at the Hoveton Hall Estate to enjoy this very special part of Norfolk, whatever the occasion.
