Placed right in the middle of Salisbury Plain, Imber was turned into a training centre for American troops in 1943. All of the inhabitants of the village were ejected with only a few weeks notice, and the village has remained uninhabited ever since. It is still used as a training ground for the British armed forces.

Once or twice a year, the village is opened to the public, and tours are available.
