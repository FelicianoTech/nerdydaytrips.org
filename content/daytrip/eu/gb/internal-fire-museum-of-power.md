All sorts of operational engines. From steam, to petrol and diesel to a jet turbine. Engines are always running while the museum is open.

If engines aren't enough, there are also telephone exchanges with extensions dotted around the site which you can call between, vintage radio equipment and a marine HF radio which licenced amateurs can operate.
