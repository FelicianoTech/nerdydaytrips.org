Ipswich Transport Museum houses over 100 vehicles and engineering pieces with local connections - basically everything that moved people around this part of Suffolk or got built here over the decades. What started as one preserved bus 50 years ago has quietly become one of the more complete regional transport collections, looked after by volunteers who actually know their stuff.
They're not open daily so check before you go, but when they do run special events you can sometimes get rides on the restored vehicles around town. Worth a look if you're into seeing how local transport networks actually worked, rather than just reading about them.
