The last working bell foundry in Britain. They do tours during the summer months, which need booking in advance. The tours cover all aspects of bell making and associated wood work. There are hundreds of bells of all sorts of sizes sitting around. They do rare casting tours as well, where you can see a casting of a bell or iron fitting.

The start and end of the tour is up stairs.
