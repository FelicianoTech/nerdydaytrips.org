Fantastic spot for neolithic burial chambers, carved rocks and standing stones.

Pull up at the Museum, stop to look at the ancient gravestones in the church before following the trail of burial mounds. All are interesting but one has a ladder down inside where you are greeted by a neolithic carved burial chamber.

Temple Wood Stone Circle is wonderful and enigmatic. see if you can find the carved spiral.

Further on are more carved standing stones in an X formation.

This can all be done in a leisurely hour and has easy flat paths. Lots of fun for kids too. Check the walls for fascinating lichens, orchids in the bog and watch out for Sand Martins in the fields.

There are many more neolithic sites and some of the most important carved rock sculpture in Europe. Better than Carnac Brittany in my opinion.
