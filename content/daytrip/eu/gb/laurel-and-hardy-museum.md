A fan-made collection of cuttings, clippings, posters, props and other memorabilia. The museum is located in a converted 1930's cinema, which feels period-appropriate. Stan Laurel was born nearby and is celebrated in several places in the town.

The collection is extensive but maybe a bit dry and without standout items. The presentation is rather dusty, chaotic and ramshackle. There is nothing here which is going to convert the unconverted. However, the real joy is in meeting the owner/curators who have devoted their lives to studying and honouring the duo.
