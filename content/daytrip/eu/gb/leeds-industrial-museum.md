Leeds Industrial Museum started life as a woollen mill, and you'll certainly find some impressive machinery related to spinning wool here, but the collections now its a museum go much further than that, covering engineering, railways, a steam engine to power the mill and cinema history (don't believe what anyone else says - it was invented in Leeds!)
