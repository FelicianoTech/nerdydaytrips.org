Remarkably preserved mill village in peaceful surroundings. The utopian vision of its founders proved to be a model for the emerging Socialist and Co-operative movements.

Now contains recreations of houses, school and mills, historic machinery, a theatre, an hotel, a themed ride and some shops. Very suitable for school-age children and any adults who have an interest in mill-architecture and early Socialist thought. A UNESCO World Heritage site.

Most of the site is accessible but there are steep hills from the main car park. There is limited diabled parking at lower levels.

The site is still home to a number of families, so please be respectful.
