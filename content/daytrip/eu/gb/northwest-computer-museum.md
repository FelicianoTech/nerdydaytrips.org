A collection of all things retrocomputing, primarily focussed around 8=bit and 16-bit computers and games consoles. Every machine they have there is working, plugged in, and visitors are encouraged to touch, play, and experiment. There is a huge collection of games and other programs, any of which can be used.

There's also a nice cafe on site, and the staff are (as you'd imagine) super friendly and helpful. Plus the website is totally awesome!
