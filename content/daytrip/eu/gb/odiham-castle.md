Ruins of a 13th-century castle which now lie on the banks of the [Basingstoke Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basingstoke_Canal). The castle was built halfway between the royal residences in Winchester and Windsor. King John rode from here to [Runnymede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runnymede) to be the Barons to sign the [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta).
