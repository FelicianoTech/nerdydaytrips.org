Old Sarum is the remains of a major town, in use from 400 BCE to 1220 CE. In the 13th century, the town migrated down the hill to the new location of Salisbury, which had a new cathedral, and by 1220, Old Sarum was abandoned. The site has the remains of the Norman castle, the church, and the town walls.
