Osborne House is a former royal residence on the Isle of Wight, built between 1845-1851 as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's summer retreat.

Queen Victoria died there in 1901, after which King Edward VII donated the house to the state. The house served various purposes, including a Royal Navy training college. Now managed by English Heritage since 1986, it operates as a public museum showcasing Victoria's private royal apartments and estate.
