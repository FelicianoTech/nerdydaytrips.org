Jacobean meets Edwardian style, the house was originally built in the 16th century, yet its interiors were extensively restored between the First and Second World Wars to create a 20th-century evocation of domestic Tudor architecture.

Packwood House contains a fine collection of 16th-century textiles and furniture, and the gardens have renowned herbaceous borders and a famous collection of yews.
