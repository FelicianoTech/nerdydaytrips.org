A tiny island with plenty of wildlife, a ruined castle to explore, a charming little pub and, oh, its own King (who happens to be the pub landlord). Safest to travel by ferry from Roa Island, it is also possible to take the dangerous route by foot over the sands from Walney at lowest tides. Only the island's residents are permitted to take motor vehicles over this route.

Short term and long term camping is available, with access to toilet facilities. Food is available at certain times on certain days in certain months: best check with the pub before travel if this is a priority.

The ferry men can arrange seal-watching trips at the weekends.
