A wall lined with memorial tablets to commemorate the bravery of ordinary people.

The character of a nation as a people of great deeds is one, it appears to me, that should not be lost sight of. It must surely be a matter of regret when names worthy to be remembered and stories stimulating and instructive are allowed to be forgotten.

George Frederic Watts, "Another Jubilee Suggestion", 5 Sep 1887
