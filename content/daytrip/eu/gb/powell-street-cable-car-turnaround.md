The site of a cable-car 'turnaround' or 'turntable' at the end of the line. It draws quite a crowd, watching the gripman stop the car, then rotate the tracks and car, ready to go back down the hill again. 

There's a stop on both sides, so you can get the cable-car up the hill, watch them turn around, then get the car back down. A line forms to get back on, though.
