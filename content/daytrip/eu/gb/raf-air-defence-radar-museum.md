The RAF Air Defence Radar Museum sits in the original Grade II listed 1942 radar operations building at Neatishead - one of the oldest radar stations in the world that's been monitoring UK airspace since 1941. What makes this place special is that you're literally standing in the rooms where they tracked enemy aircraft during WWII and Soviet spy planes during the Cold War.
The real highlight is the complete Cold War Operations Room, preserved exactly as it was when they decommissioned it in 2004. This is where fighter controllers would scramble jets to intercept aerial intruders during the tensest moments of the Cold War. The original radar equipment is still there, complete with the plotting boards and communication systems they used to coordinate air defence.
