Part of the larger Royal College of Physicians Museum, the garden is devoted to plants that were believed to have medicinal value in ancient and medieval times. Open every weekday from 9:00 to 5:00 if you want to explore on your own, while a physician-guided tour is available on the first Wednesday of each month at 2 PM.
