Reading Buses is the locally-owned public service bus company for Reading and the surrounding area, and the holder (since 2015) of the land speed record for a double-decker bus.

Normally, the main depot is closed to the public, but once a year in the summer, they hold an open day.

See old buses, brand new buses, the control room, the workshops, and more!
