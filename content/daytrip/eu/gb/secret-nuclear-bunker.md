Brilliant piece of cold war history hiding below an innocuous looking bungalow.

We visited to drop my son off at the high  ropes site next door with some of his friends, decided to stay and visit the bunker and emerged some hours later, to find my son waiting.

If you like history, old technology and are a bit of a geek you'll love it.
