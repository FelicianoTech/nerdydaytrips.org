Shakespeare's Birthplace has been welcoming visitors for over 250 years. William Shakespeare was born, grew up and he played here. He ate meals in the hall and he slept and dreamed in these rooms. Shakespeare also spent the first five years of married life in this house with his new wife, Anne Hathaway.

For millions of Shakespeare enthusiasts worldwide, the house is a shrine.
