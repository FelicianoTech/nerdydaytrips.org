The Sheerness Heritage Centre is  housed  in a weather boarded cottage that was built in the early 19th century as a dwelling for a  dockyard worker. Despite being constructed of seemingly temporary building materials the house, as with its two neighbours, has lasted well and, over the years, it has also been a baker's shop and a fish and chip shop. Now cared for, the rooms here have been restored and they now reflect authentic 19th century rooms and are furnished with genuine pieces from that period.

        Little known treasure of a museum.
