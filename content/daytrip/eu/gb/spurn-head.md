Went here first time on a clear sky night with a bunch of my student mates. it truely is a mad place. the view of the BP refinery at night is better than my home town Blackpool's illuminations. and the oil rig lights, stars, and oil tankers silently cruising by in the dark is an experience best done high and drunk with friends. fantastic times. nice in the dat to as it is so far out in the sea.
