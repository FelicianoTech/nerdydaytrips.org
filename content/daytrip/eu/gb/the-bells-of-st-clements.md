As far as I know this is the only place in the country offering daily public demonstrations of the art of bellringing. The half-hour experience includes an introduction to the history of ringing, how the patterns of ‘changes’ are constructed, and the opportunity to have a go at chiming a bell, full-circle ringing, and change ringing on handbells.
Open from 2-3pm every weekday afternoon, £8 each. Can be booked in advance or walk-in on the day.
