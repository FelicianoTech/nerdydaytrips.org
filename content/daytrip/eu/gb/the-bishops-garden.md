A popular place for many years and still a favourite, attracting visitors yearly is the Bishop’s garden. A four acre walled garden dating back to the 12th century in the grounds of the Bishop’s House.

This garden is another of Norwich’s secret gardens; small woodland walk, kitchen garden, ornate gardens, bamboo walk, grass labyrinth, boxed rose beds, plant sales, refreshments,.
