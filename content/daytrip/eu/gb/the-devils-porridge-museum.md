The Devil's Porridge: Cordite, an explosive and propellant used heavily in the First World War.

This location near Gretna, on the south coast of Scotland, was a major factory for cordite in the 20th century, and the museum tells the story of the factory, and of the history of the area in both world wars and the cold war.
