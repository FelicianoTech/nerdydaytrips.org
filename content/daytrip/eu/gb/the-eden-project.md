Extensive gardens, in the bowl of an old quarry. A connected series of enclosed domes ("biomes") hold large collections of plants from other climates -- rainforest and the Mediterranean. There is also a permanent exhibit, "Invisible Worlds", about things that are outside the range of our own senses -- too big, too small, too fast, too far away.
