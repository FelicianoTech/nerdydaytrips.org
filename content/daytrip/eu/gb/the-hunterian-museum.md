<em>Gotan said:</em>

        The Hunterian Museum is located in the Royal College of surgeons, it contains a fantastic of things related to surgery, medicine and anything related to these subjects, from the skeleton of the Irish giant to surgical tools preserved parts in jars, a great day out, though may be a little squeamish for younger children.
