The MAD Museum (Mechanical Art and Design) is a wonderfully eccentric attraction located in the heart of Stratford-upon-Avon. 

The museum showcases a collection of interactive mechanical art, with a focus on kinetic sculptures and automata.

Imagine the imaginative contraptions from Wallace and Gromit, the creativity of Scrapheap Challenge or the whimsical inventions in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and you're half way there.
