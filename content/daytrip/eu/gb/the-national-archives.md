The National Archives in Kew is pretty much the UK's ultimate data backup with over 1,000 years of history stored in one place. From medieval manuscripts to Cold War secrets, it's like a real-life time machine for information geeks. Think government-grade lore library meets digital archive. Browse declassified spy files, old maps, or even the Domesday Book.
