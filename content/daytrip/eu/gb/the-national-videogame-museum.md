A collection of old and new video games, including some cool experimental ones. If you're just browsing expect to spend a couple of hours, if you want to spend time with friends competing on Dance Dance Revolution or Donkey Kong Racing or the like, maybe longer. There's also cabinets full of gaming memorabilia and historical items.
