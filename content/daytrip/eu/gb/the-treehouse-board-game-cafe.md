The Treehouse is Sheffield's first board game caf√© - it's this really cool, laid-back place where you can try out games from their massive collection of over 800 titles. Whether you've never touched a board game or you're already obsessed, the staff there are brilliant at helping you find something fun and explaining how everything works.
They've also got a great drinks menu with craft beers on tap, cocktails, milkshakes, and really good coffee, plus food that's made with ingredients from local suppliers around Sheffield. It's just a really welcoming spot for anyone who wants to hang out and play some games.
