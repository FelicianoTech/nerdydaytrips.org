A mining museum at a former colliery, one of the last deep pits to operate in the UK. As well as the industrial history of the region, the site also has an excellent programme of arts and events, hosts the County Archives, and nearby Woodhorn Colliery Railway through the Country Park is currently in restoration (as of May 2025)
