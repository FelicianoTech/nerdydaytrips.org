The world's first commercial automatic MagLev train.

Ran on an elevated, 600m/2000ft long track between Birmingham International Airport (BHX) and Birmingham International Rail Station from 1984-1995.

The track infrastructure is still in place and since 2003 the route has been serviced by a cable-hauled AirRail Link Cable Liner system.
