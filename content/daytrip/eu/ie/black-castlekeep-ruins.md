This castle ruin stands on a rocky promontory over the sea, at the eastern side of the town. It is a fine vantage-point for views over the town and the coast of North Wicklow from the ruins. 

The casle was built in the late 1170's by the Normal family, the Fitzgeralds. The keep was entered by crossing a drawbridge. This castle was destroyed in 1301.
