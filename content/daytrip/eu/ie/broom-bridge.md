In 1843, the mathematician Alexander Hamilton was working on extending complex numbers from two to four dimensions. Going on a walk along the Royal Canal to clear his head, he had the core inspiration of how to make them work.

Not having any paper to hand, he scratched the equations onto the side of Broom Bridge.

The original equations are gone, but there remains a plaque on the bridge to commemorate Hamilton's inscription.
