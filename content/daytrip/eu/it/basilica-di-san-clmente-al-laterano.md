In the 19th century, the priest in this 11th century church started clearing out some rubble. He discovered an entire second church underneath the one (now) at ground level -- this one built in the 4th century.

And then underneath that, he found the 1st century Roman street, house and Mithraeum that the church had been built on top of.

You can now visit all three levels.
