This is an enormous, strongly built steel enclosure on the steep slope under the limestone cliffs above Pizzone village. A boulder has fallen from the cliff and smashed through the fence, then bent one of the huge steel legs of the viewing platform like putty. The enclosure is overgrown and abandoned, but quite recently; there is not much rust on the steel and the weeds are not very thick or strong. What was it? Who built it, when?
