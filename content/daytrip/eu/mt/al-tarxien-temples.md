Neolithic temples, preserved to be looked around. The whole complex is under a big tent roof, and only the walls of the temples remain, but you can see the layout and walk through on guided paths. Has an audio guide that can be opened as a website, so take your headphones. (https://txn.myvisit.live/langlist)
