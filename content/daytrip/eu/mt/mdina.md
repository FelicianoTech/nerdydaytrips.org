Mdina. The Silent City. If you’re into history, it’s a very well preserved fortified city which has been inhabited continuously since before written records, and has many fine examples of baroque architecture dating from when it was the capital of Malta in the mediaeval period and later into the era of the knightly Order of St. John. If you’re more the computer game sort of nerd… it’s what every Assassins Creed level dreams of being when it grows up. The temptation to look for Indiana Jones-style secret doorways in statues and the like is almost irresistible. 
Easily accessible by bus from all over the island, too.
