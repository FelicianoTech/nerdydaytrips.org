Divided into three parts: the Neolithic period, the Phoenician, and the Bronze Age. The Neolithic part has many well preserved prehistoric artefacts, as well as the actual stones from the temples at Tarxian, carved with flint tools into spirals and representations of animals. They have an audio guide which you can open as a website on your phone and provide a good explanation of some of the history which isnâ€™t written on the cards, so take your headphones.
