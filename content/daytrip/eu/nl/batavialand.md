Museum that started out as social project to reconstruct a Dutch East Indiaman trading ship. The Batavia that was built here can be visited as well as the shipyard where a new reconstruction is being built. In the shipyard all trades necessary to built such a ship are shown. 

The museum also has a part on the history of Flevoland, from the land reclamation part to underwater archeology in the whole Northsea and former Zuiderzee.
