The BlenderInstitute, the working company of the blender foundation.

From the institute's web page :- "Can I come visit?
Yes! But only on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday between 14-17h. You are welcome for a quick 5-minute tour. Keep in mind the team will be busy so visits have to be limited in time.

If you want to bring us something; no alcoholic drinks or candy please, simply bring the ugliest (touristic) fridge magnet from your hometown!"
