Due to its high population density, the Netherlands has a lot of light pollution and the night sky is not very well visible in most places. The Boschplaat nature reserve however is as far away from human settlement as you can get in the Netherlands. Here you can see the stars and the milky way so well that it is officially recognized as a dark sky park. The nature reserve is open 24 h/day.
