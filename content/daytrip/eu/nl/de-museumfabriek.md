De Museumfabriek in Enschede is a vibrant and interactive family museum, uniquely blending nature, culture, science, and technology. It's housed in a captivating space that combines a beautifully renovated old textile factory—a nod to Enschede's rich industrial past—with a sleek, modern new building. This isn't your typical quiet museum; it's designed for hands-on exploration and discovery.

Rather than simply observing, visitors of all ages are encouraged to participate, experiment, and create. The museum delves into "the coherence of things," showcasing how diverse fields intertwine. You'll encounter fascinating natural history collections, including an impressive mammoth skeleton, alongside engaging insights into Twente's social and cultural heritage. Interactive displays are central to the experience, sparking curiosity and making learning an active adventure.

A standout feature is the Makerspace, a hub where creativity flourishes with access to tools like 3D printers and laser cutters. For those with an interest in the cosmos, there's also an observatory for stargazing.

Essentially, De Museumfabriek aims to be a "museum of wondrous science," where imagination is key and visitors are invited to actively engage with the exhibits, making it a truly unique and enriching experience for the whole family. It's also recognized as an Anchor Point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
