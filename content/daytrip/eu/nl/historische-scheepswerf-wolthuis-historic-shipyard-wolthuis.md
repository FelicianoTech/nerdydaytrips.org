Historic Shipyard in the province of Groningen. Groningen has a longstanding history of shipbuilding. Most shipyards were located along canals, making it necessarry to launch ships sideways. In 1983 the canal along which shipyard Wolthuis (one of the oldest in Groningen) was located was closed and the shipyard was turned into a museum.
