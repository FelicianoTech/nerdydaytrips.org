Storm surge barrier that protects Rotterdam and a large part of South-Holland against the Northsea. Since the river could not be obstructed for shipping, two giant doors had to be built that float until they almost reach each other and are then sunk to the river bottom. This way the river is almost comleteley closed.

Tip: try to visit when they perform a test closure (once a year)
