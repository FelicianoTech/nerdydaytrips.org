In the 19th century the Netherlands were relatively poor, especially in the city's there were a lot of people who could not sustain themselves. The voluntary peat bog colonies were set up so that people could be re-educated to a sober, hard-working lifestyle on the countryside. This museum tells the story about the colonies and its people.
