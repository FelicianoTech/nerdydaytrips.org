Historic railway between Stadskanaal and Ter Apel-Rijksgrens. Nowadays running between Veendam and Nieuw-Buinen. Has both steam and diesel locomotives. In Stadskanaal there is also a museum and workshops that can be visited. In Veendam you can change over to the regular Dutch railway system.

Note: there are plans to extend the line to Emmen and make it part of the regular Dutch railway network again, the so called Nedersaksenlijn.
