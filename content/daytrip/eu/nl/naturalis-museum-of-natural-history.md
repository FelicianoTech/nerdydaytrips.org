Research institute and museum of natural history with an extensive collection, crowned by objects such as the third most complete Tyrannosaur Rex skeleton in the world (Trix), the world's first herd of Triceratops, a collection of meteorites and much more over the 9 floors of the museum. As this is an active research centre, there is also a floor dedicated to current research.
