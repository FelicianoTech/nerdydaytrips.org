Open air theatre where each summer a Shakespeare play is performed by volunteers, who are mostly from the local village of Diever and its surroundings. It seems like the whole village somehow supports the theater, from making costumes and decors to selling food during the break. Most of the times the stage and decors are a work of art all by themselves.

In wintertime a different play is performed in the covered Globe theater.
