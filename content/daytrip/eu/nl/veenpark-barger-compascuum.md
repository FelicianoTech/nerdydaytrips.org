Open air museum village in a former peat colony. In the village you can explore how peat was extracted from the peatlands. It was then dried and transported to Holland to be used as fuel for domestic heating. Also all professions and trades that you would find in a village of that time are shown in approriate workshops. Last but not least: the park has two narrow gauge trains.
