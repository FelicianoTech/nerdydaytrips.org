The national monument Waterloopbos is an area where the Dutch have learned to work with water, waves and current. It used to be a laboratory where research was conducted in order to construct civil works to protect The Netherlands (and other countries) from the sea and to engage in land reclamation. When computers took over this research the area was reclaimed by nature, but the ruins of the test sites can still be found.
