Canning! Could it get any more exciting? You’d be surprised. Stavanger’s culture and history is deeply embedded in the fishing and producing of sardines. This museum tells the story of the Canning Factory and its development over the years. It’s in equal parts fascinating and horrifying when you realise the dangers and squalid conditions the worked had to endure. You also get to see the world’s largest sardine tin!!!
