In 1975, the seed for Arboretum Norr began to grow. It was the Danish dendrologist Carl-Gustaf Thøgersen’s idea to establish the world’s northernmost arboretum in Baggböle. Carl-Gustaf, who came to Umeå University in 1974 to study, had previously worked in various arboreta and felt that northern Sweden lacked a place dedicated to botanical and dendrological science. He emphasized the importance of research material for both education and studies, but also for landscape architects, garden technicians, foresters and a wide range of educational activities in society. The location would also provide Umeå with a new recreational area where visitors could enjoy exotic tree species in the company of the river landscape.

Our main arboretum is located about 10 km outside of Umeå city in the small village Baggböle. It is positioned in a scenic landscape right next to the swirling white rapids of the Umeå river. With Baggböle manor in the center, the arboretum occupies a 1 km stretch of the steep slope along the northern shore of the river. The south-facing exposure and the close proximity to the water make the growing conditions very favorable.

Today its a well grown beautiful park landscape with winding stairs crossing the slope. Its a big park about 1 km long with zones for different continents. Well worth a visit to learn about.. trees?
