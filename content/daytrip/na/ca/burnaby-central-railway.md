A very cool place to watch and ride on miniature trains. Available weekends and holidays from Easter through to Canadian Thanksgiving. Often they also run some evenings leading up to Halloween (if Halloween is on a convenient day) and also sometimes run the trains at Christmas time. Check the website for details. Hours generally are 11:00am to 5:00pm (but show up earlier so there is time to ride the train). Just park in the city parking lot right beside the trains (to the East), or on the street. Note the parking lot across the street is not a public city lot but belongs to the lawn bowling (private club).\, so donâ€™t try to park there.
