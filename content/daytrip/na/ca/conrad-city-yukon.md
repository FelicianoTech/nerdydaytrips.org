Conrad City is a ghost town located on the shores of Windy Arm.  Conrad City sprang up in  the early 1900's when John Conrad began mining gold &amp; silver ore from nearby Montana Mountain.  The ore was hauled off of the mountain in an 80 ore bucket cable tramway.  The tram terminated in Conrad City where the ore was loaded on to river boats and eventually on to the White Pass &amp; Yukon Rail headed for smelters down south.  In its heyday, Conrad City was home to more than 500 people.  Several old, disintegrating log cabins and tram towers are still visible in the old town site.
