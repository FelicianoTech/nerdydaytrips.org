Nestled in a majestic setting in the St. John River valley, Kings Landing Historical Settlement depicts the one hundred year transformation of a young colony into a vibrant nation. Listen for creaking wagons pulled by trotting work horses, the whooshing of hoop skirts, and the distant melodies from lively fiddlers and dancing townsfolk. Witness the bustle of farm life, and learn first hand how ordinary people lived and worked in the 19th century. An epic story that’s more than just history, it’s history, well told.
