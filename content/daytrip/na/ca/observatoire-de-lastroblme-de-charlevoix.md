An interpretive centre devoted to the Charlevoix impact structure, a mostly buried 50-kilometer wide crater forming the surrounding area. As well as the interactive show they put on there's a hiking experience to see some of the crater's geology exposed at the surface (oddly paired with a guided tour of local weir fishing history) and evening stargazing.

The central peak of the crater, disguised as a low mountain with the town of Les Éboulements on it, can also be visited if you drive about 20 kilometers to the southwest,
