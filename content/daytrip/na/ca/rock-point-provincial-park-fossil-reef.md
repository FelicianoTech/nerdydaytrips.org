Notable for a fossilized reef in its eastern end, Rock Point is a pebbly beach on the shores of Lake Erie, with short hiking trails north of the beach. The reef is a flat shelf of rock along the shore just before Rockhouse Point, a bit above the waterline. It dates back to the Devonian, about 350 million years ago, consisting mainly of crushed elements but also more-complete rugose and tabulate corals.
