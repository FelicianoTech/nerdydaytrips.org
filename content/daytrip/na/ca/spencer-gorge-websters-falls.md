A stroll through Spencer Gorge can bring you to Tew's Falls, Dundas Peak, and/or Webster's falls, whilst offering you a picturesque view of the greenery and the calming sounds of the falls. After a walk down a steep flight of stairs, you will reach Webster's Falls and an opportunity to take a dip beneath the running water.
