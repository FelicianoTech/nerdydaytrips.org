A sanctuary farm for rescued donkeys. Some are quite friendly and yes, you can give them scritches through the paddock fence.

Open to the public on most Sundays from the first Sunday in May to the last Sunday in October, as well as some days during the December holiday season. Tickets in advance are recommended.
