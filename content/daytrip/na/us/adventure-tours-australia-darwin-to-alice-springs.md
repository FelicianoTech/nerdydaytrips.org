In the early hours of the morning, we make a stop at Tennant Creek so that you can stretch your legs and grab some refreshments before we continue on to Alice Springs. There is also one last photo stop as we cross the tropic of Capricorn. We arrive at our final destination around 8am. You have the rest of the day free to explore the heart of the Red Centre.
