This is the nerdiest museum I have ever been to.  It's a museum about Air Force logistics.

There are many historical transport and cargo planes on display.  You can get a guided tour and walk around in the planes that are used to transport tank weapons cross the world.  There is an exhibit about the Berlin Airlift, which supplied Berlin with food and fuel for 15 months during the Soviet blockade of the city after World War 2.  There are also interesting oddities such as a howitzer-in-a-box that could be airdropped to advancing infantry positions.
