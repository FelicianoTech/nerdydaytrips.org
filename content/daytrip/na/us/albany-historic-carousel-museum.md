Working turn-of-the-century carousel with lovingly carved animals, each sponsored by individual donors and hand-carved over thousands of hours with unique details. Some resemble beloved pets; others favorite animals of friends or family. There are equines and mythical creatures and dogs and cats and birds. Almost all staff are volunteers with a passion for history and art, and you can take a behind-the-scenes tour to learn about the place and see the carousel animals who are waiting for their turn (they rotate them regularly so as not to damage them.) Open WED-SUN 11-4; closed MON/TUES.
