Alkek Velodrome is the only facility for training for high speed bicycling in the entire state of Texas. Although many of the open hours are taken up with professional training sessions, the velodrome also offers hours for public usage. Sessions for skaters are also available, which makes this attraction popular with both serious skaters and cyclists
