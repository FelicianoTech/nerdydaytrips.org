Great computer history museum in Bozeman.Among many exhibits they have an Apple I, donated by and signed by Wozniak. 

According to their website, their "...exhibits span 4,000 years of human history, from original cuneiform tablets to the first personal computers, and include topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, the Space Race, Cracking the Enigma Code, and more."

Very worth a visit to any nerd worth the name.
