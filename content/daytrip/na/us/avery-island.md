Touring the visitor center and the pepper sauce factory is just one part of the Avery Island experience. In addition to seeing how we age TABASCO® Sauce in white oak barrels and ship it all over the world, you can visit Avery Island’s 170-acre Jungle Gardens and see, in season, a variety of azaleas, camellias and bamboo.
