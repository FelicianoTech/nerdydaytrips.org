The second-largest Hindu temple complex in the world is in central New
Jersey and is open to the public.  Check out a traditional stepped
pond, a 49-foot gilded staue of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, hundreds of
carvings of Hindu gods, and magnificent architecture.  Admission is
free. Guided tours are available, or just wander the grounds and the
buildings.

There is a cafeteria and a gift shop, and the neighborhood is full of
excellent Indian restaurants.
