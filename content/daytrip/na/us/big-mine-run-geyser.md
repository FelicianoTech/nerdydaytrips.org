The only geyser in the state of Pennsylvania, one with an unusual back story.

The abandoned town of Centralia is nearby and the heat of the long-term underground coal seam fire there affected the flooded tunnels of the former Bast Colliery. That drives the colliery's water up, where it gushes as much as 15 feet in the air during periods of heavy rain.

The geyser is on private land but can be seen about 5-10 meters away from the side of Big Run Mine Road.
