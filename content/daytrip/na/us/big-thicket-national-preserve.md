The Big Thicket National Preserve was established by Congress in 1974. This combination of virgin pine and cypress forest, hardwood forest, meadow and blackwater swamp is managed by the National Park Service. The Preserve was established to protect the remnant of its complex biological diversity. What is so extraordinary is not the rarity or abundance of its life forms, but how many species coexist here.

Activities in the Big Thicket National Preserve include hiking, camping, bicycling, horseback riding, canoeing, birdwatching, fishing and more. Visitors find the Big Thicket to be a fun, educational trip for the entire family.
