Mathematician Emmy Noether made seminal contributions to abstract algebra (ring theory) and mathematical physics (Noether's theorem).  In 1933 she fled Germany and took up a position at Bryn Mawr.  When she died, she was buried in the central courtyard of the old library, called "the Cloister".  A stone marks the location.
