The Cape Ann Museum has a number of collections relating to this rich cultural heritage, including an extensive selection of maritime paintings and landscapes by American artists such as Fitz Henry Lane, Milton Avery and John Sloan. In addition to its permanent collections, the Museum offers a rotating schedule of special exhibits throughout the year.

Note that their Downtown Campus is closed for renovation, and will reopen in Spring 2026. The linked location is their Green Campus.

        It is also possible to catch a lecture here by a living artist on a fairly regular basis. I was lucky enough to stumble upon Sigrid Olsen (painter and clothing designer) one day!
