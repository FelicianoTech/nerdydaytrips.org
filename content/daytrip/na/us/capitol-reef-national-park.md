Capitol Reef is one of the smaller parks in Utah. When I mention it to locals, they frequently haven't heard of the place. It is filled with beautiful sandstone formations, an old Mormon pioneer settlement with their original fruit trees that anyone can pick fruit from, ancient Native American pictographs and petroglyphs, gorgeous desert flora and fauna. Excellent place to spend a few days exploring. Also, Check out the town of Torrey, it is a great spot for a home base.
