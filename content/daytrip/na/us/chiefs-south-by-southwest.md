Chiefs is located just a few blocks from DePauw University, right off the historical courthouse square in downtown Greencastle, IN. Inspired by the classic barbecue joints, "fish shacks", and Cajun / Creole food of the American South, chef/owner Stephen Geabes opened Chiefs in 2007.

All sauces and soups are house made. Produce is locally grown whenever possible. Chiefs, unlike their local competitors, cooks with style and flavor.

Try the Charismatic Catfish, Choice USDA Steaks, Cajun Crawfish Alfredo, BBQ Ribs, Peach Cobbler, Burgers, Pastas, Salads and much, much more! An excellent beer and wine list rounds out an exciting menu.

        My mom manages this restaurant and it is a huge hit among travelers, townies, and all the diverse college students of DePauw University!
