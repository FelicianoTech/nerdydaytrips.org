Located in scenic Eden Park, the Cincinnati Art Museum features a diverse, encyclopedic art collection of more than 73,000 works spanning 6,000 years. In addition to displaying its own broad collection, the museum also hosts several national and international traveling exhibitions each year.

Visitors can enjoy the exhibitions or participate in the museumâ€™s wide range of art-related programs, activities and special events. General admission is always free for all, thanks to the Rosenthal Family Foundation.
