This museum contains a sizeable collection of both standard and narrow gauge locomotives from various western railroads, with specific attention paid to the Denver & Rio Grande Western railroad. Noted train YouTuber Hyce (https://www.youtube.com/@Hyce777) works here as well, and has made several videos on the museum campus.
