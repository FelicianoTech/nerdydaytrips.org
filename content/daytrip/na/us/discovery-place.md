Discovery Place is a science and technology museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. Discovery Place brings science to life through hands-on interactive exhibits, thrilling activities and experiments, a larger-than-life IMAX Dome Theatre, and boundless other educational opportunities and programs.

The Museum, which first opened in 1981, recently underwent a renovation that transformed it into a reimagined state-of-the-art science and technology museum. The most recent exhibition additions to Discovery Place include World Alive, Fantastic-Frogs and three Explore More hands-on labs.

Discovery Place also operates an IMAX Dome Theatre which offers an immersive, up-close movie experience in the largest IMAX Dome Theatre in the Carolinas.

        Get the season passes, they're worth it. Also, try the delicious cupcakes they have on the bottom floor.

If you have little ones, there is a fun exhibit just for kids 7 and under on the bottom floor.
