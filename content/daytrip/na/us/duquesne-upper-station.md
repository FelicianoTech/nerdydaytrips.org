The Duquesne Incline is a funicular system that has been hauling people up and down Duquesne heights since 1877.  The machinery that makes it work is on display.  Where does the cable go?  What will happen if it breaks?  

When they built the incline, they wanted to build the power house with the engines an a straight line with the rest of the track.  But they couldn't get the land across Grandville Avenue.  So the cables have to make a right-angle turn at the top of the hill!

And the view from the top is great.
