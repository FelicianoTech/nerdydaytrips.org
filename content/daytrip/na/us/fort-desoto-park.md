        The largest park in Pinellas County.
5 interconnected islands with an incredible natural ecosytem of native plants and birds. 
Some highlights include:
a historic fort
over seven miles of waterfront and three miles of beach
boat launch
canoe, kayak, boat, and paddle boat rentals
camping
picnic areas
hiking and biking trails
two fishing piers
ferry boat to Egmont Key
There is more but I'm sure your nerdy brain is already reeling on this marvel. Whether you make it a day trip or a week of camping, don't miss out on Fort Desoto when you come to visit St. Petersburg!
