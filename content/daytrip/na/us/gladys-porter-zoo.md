This is one of the best zoos in the country, with a collection of exotic animals, both native to the area and from around the world.  Every effort is made to reproduce the animals' natural habitats.  You can easily spend an entire afternoon or even the whole day here.  If you want a little break, right across the street one way is Dean Porter Park (huge, with playgrounds and cooking areas) and the other way is Brownsville Fine Arts Museum.
