Historic house - first work of architect B.H. Latrobe, also well known for the White House and Capitol Building in Washington D.C.

Tours are run between June and September on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons (2pm).

        The tours are... unusual! The owner spends almost as much time in mid-air as he does on the ground. These tours aren't only about the house - they seem to cover philisophy, theory of music and Ancient Greek religion.

Excellent value for money (Â£6) and a decent slice of cake at the end.
