A magnet, and sometimes home, for the creative giants of the city; in legend, the proprietor would eschew rent for works of art. Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, Leonard Cohen, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Chet Baker, Jack Kerouac, Arthur Miller, Uma Thurman and Tom Waits have resided, frequented or imbibed therein. Of course, there is also the darkness: famously, Dylan Thomas succumbed to alcohol, morphine and pneumonia above the bar and Sex Pistol Sid Vicious murdered Nancy Spungen in room 100.

These days it has been transformed from a shabby artists' den into an upmarket and elegant hotel. But don't feel intimidated to step inside, even if you cannot afford a room. The walls are still bedecked with art, the interiors are wondrous and cosy and the staff are delighted custodians and raconteurs.

Much of New York's musical and artistic heritage has been lost, but the good old Chelsea Girl survives.
