The HOUSTON Fire Museum was originally Fire Station No. 7, the first fire station built by the Houston Fire Department after it went fully paid in 1895. 

Preservation of old Fire Station No. 7 as a fire museum began in 1980.  Today, the Houston Fire Museum has been completely renovated and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

As activities at the Fire Museum outgrew the old fire station at the turn of the century, and the Board of Trustees decided to build a new Fire Museum a block away on Main Street and Hadley. The old museum will still remain as part of the Fire Museum, and the old museum be renovated to look as it did in 1899 when it was built, together with an old steamer and hose wagon.
