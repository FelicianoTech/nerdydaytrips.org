The Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University is one of the largest and most distinguished university-based museums in the country. It collects, preserves, researches, and exhibits world-class works of art to provide the university community and diverse regional, national, and international audiences with direct experience of the visual arts. Scholarly activities make art intellectually accessible through exhibitions, publications, and educational programs.
