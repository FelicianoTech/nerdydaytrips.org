A nursery dedicated to growing a large variety of miniature orchid species from around the world. Some are for sale, and a portion of the collection is on display. Staff are plant enthusiasts, so itâ€™s great for plant nerds to visit and have a chat. 

Open Fridays and Saturdays without appointment, rest of the week appointments are needed.
