The conservatory was completed in 1933, replacing smaller greenhouses that had stood in Eden Park since 1894.[1] Originally known only as the Eden Park Greenhouse, in 1937 it was renamed in honor of Irwin M. Krohn. The architecture firm Rapp & Meacham designed the conservatory in the Art Deco style, in the form of a Gothic arch.

It contains more than 3,500 plant species from all over the world,[7] with principal collections as follows:
    Bonsai Collection
    Desert Garden
    Floral Display
    Orchid Display
    Palm House
    Tropical House
As well as a 20-foot (6.1 m) waterfall[9] with a goldfish stream. Epiphytic bromeliads, orchids, and ferns grow in many of the trees
