This museum features a giant room full of rows and rows of full size trains, many you can climb onboard and walk through. The museum is very well interpreted and features interpretation around Hobos (train hitchhikers) and life around trains.

During off hours, the museum is relatively sensory friendly, but it can be very hot and stagnant, and clearances onboard trains can be tight.

 Tickets are $14 for adults, $7 for children under 13. There is a $1 discount for active duty military and veterans, and some staff members will give a $4 discount to students with ID.
