Open since the 1930s, Lost River Caverns is a series of underground chambers carved out by a  water source from an unknown origin that disappears back into the earth just as mysteriously. It's full of fascinating cave formations, crystals, and remains at roughly 52 degrees year round. Bring your camera!
