Take an airboat tour if you want to or drop your personal outboard on the north side of the levee and explore the wildlife on your own.  I, personally like to drive out there when I feel those sluggish streams of rush hour traffic, blinding buzzing lights, and big city walls all start to close in around me.  I just sit, night or day, and take in the natural beauty that I all too often forget 

Florida has to offer.  It's not much, but sometimes it's just enough natural freedom to get me through the week.
