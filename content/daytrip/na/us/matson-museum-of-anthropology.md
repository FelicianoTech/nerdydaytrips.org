On view in the galleries you will find casts of fossil ancestors that speak to the beginnings of human diversity and stories of how scientific anthropologists study our complex bodies. Exhibits on archaeology—the study of humans in the past—contain objects shaped by peoples’ hands that convey important histories from antiquity told by rare fragments that survived over time.
