This is an old gristmill renovated into a bookstore, right beside the CT river, that sells used and new books, hence has a big and unconventional collection. Nearby is a cute cafe, restaurants with live music, and an art exhibition. Oh, and its restroom walls are filled with very old newspaper clippings and posters. Franklin bikeway leads up to it which is a pretty bike path.
