A portion of the border between Pennsylvania and Delaware is the “twelve-mile circle”,
the only U.S. state boundary that is a circular arc.  The center of the circle is the court house in New Castle.

Your nerd bona fides will be enhanced by visiting this unique point of purely geometric and cartographic significance.

You can also get a tour of the court house itself, which was built in 1732.
