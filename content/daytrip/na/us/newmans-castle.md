Experience the old world charm of Newmanâ€™s Castle, a one-of-a-kind custom creation hidden just outside of Bellville in the rolling countryside.

The castle features a moat (watch out for gators!), a massive working 3,000 lb. drawbridge with an accompanying portcullis, a chapel, five round corner turrets, a courtyard, and a central keep with a dramatic view of the surrounding lands. A perimeter wall encompasses the castle, ensuring you are safe from oncoming marauders during your visit.
