The only campsite and certainly the best campsite on Fraser Island. Cathedral is not just your ordinary tent, if there is a five start rating for tent accommodation then this is your 5 star ultimate camping tent.

Named after the coloured pinnacle sands, and centrally situated near Eli Creek- just a short drive, Maheno Wreck and Lake Allom makes your camping very convenient.

Cathedrals has awesome amenities and facilities such as hot showers, toilets, two fully equipped kitchens, BBQ facilities, laundry, communal firepits and most of all they have a convenience store called "The Oasis" and if you do ran out of supplies just check them out, they also have a bottle shop making it conveninent for campers who wants to party.

This is not just a tent and an ordinary camping adventure, it is a first class camping!
