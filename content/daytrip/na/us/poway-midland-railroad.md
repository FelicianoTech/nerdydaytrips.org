The Poway-Midland Railroad is a full-size, narrow-gauge railroad in Old Poway Park which carries passengers aboard vintage and antique railroad equipment. The railroad is owned by the City of Poway, and operated by the Poway Midland Railroad Volunteers, is a 501 (c) 3 Corporation that exists on passenger ticket fares and donations.
