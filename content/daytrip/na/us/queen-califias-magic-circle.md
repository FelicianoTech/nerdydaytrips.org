Queen Califia's Magical Circle is the only American sculpture garden and the last major international project created by Niki de Saint Phalle (born in France, 1930 to 2002). Inspired by California's mythic, historic, and cultural roots, the garden consists of nine large-scale sculptures, a circular "snake wall" and maze entryway, sculpturally integrated bench seating, and native shrubs and trees planted within the interior plaza and along the outer perimeter. The garden bears the brilliant, unique mosaic ornamentation that is an unmistakable part of Saint Phalle's later work.

Queen Califia's Magical Circle is situated within a 12-acre natural habitat in the Iris Sankey Arboretum in Kit Carson Park. The park's entrance is located five minutes from I-15 (Via Rancho Parkway Exit) at the corner of Bear Valley Parkway and Mary Lane. Kit Carson Park also includes a frisbee golf course, playgrounds, and plenty of picnic areas. Though the park is open every day, please check the website for the hours of the sculpture garden.
