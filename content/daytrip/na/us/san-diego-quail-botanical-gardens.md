A beautiful garden open to the public. It includes everything from the local coastal sage-scrub communities to lush tropical plants arranged along many long, meandering paths which pass by waterfalls, ponds, sculptures, and so much more!

In the recent past they increased the price of parking/admission, so I suggest parking outside the park and just walking through the entrance gate and immediately taking a hard right (where you can see the park trail winding through the garden) and join the trail there.
