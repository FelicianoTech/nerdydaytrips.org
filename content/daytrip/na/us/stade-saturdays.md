After the first successful year, Stade Saturdays returns for another exciting and diverse season in 2013.

The Stade Open Space is right on the seafront, along the Old Town, by the side of the Jerwood Gallery, the traditional beach-launched fisihng fleet and the iconic net shops.

Stade Saturdays, with a few exceptions, start at 7.30pm - so make your way down to a free performance on the seafront.

        Great day/afternoon/night out. International artists and on the 15.6.2013 Vulcan bomber will be in the skies.
