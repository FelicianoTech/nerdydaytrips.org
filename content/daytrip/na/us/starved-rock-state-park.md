Exposed rock formations created by receding glacial floods created several canyons and waterfalls (rather unique in the mostly flat lands of the US Midwest). There are several hiking trails with varying levels of ease and distances, the park also offers camping, fishing, kayaking, boating, and most importantly picknicking! 
It's easily accessible from Interstate 39 and next to the also impressive Matthiessen State Park.
