H.P. Lovecraft's Gravesite. One of Providence, Rhode Island's little historical treasures. Lovecraft's gravesite was purchased for him by fans and it lies somewhere in the center of this beautiful cemetery. Many fans make the pilgrimage every August 20th for his birthday or every March 15th for his death day. It is in the visitor's best interest to ask security where the site is or hours will be wasted looking.
