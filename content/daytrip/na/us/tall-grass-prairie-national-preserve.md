Come see The West as it once was. This preserve represents the largest remaining section of the tall grass prairie left in the United States. If you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse the heard of Bison that calls this prairie home. The preserve is also situated on the site of a historic ranch, and all of the ranch buildings remain and are open to the public. The area's former one room school house is a short hike through the prairie away. Head south into Strong City for lunch.
