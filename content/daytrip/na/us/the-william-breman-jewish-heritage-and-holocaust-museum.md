The Breman celebrates and commemorates the Jewish experience and the universal themes of diversity and human dignity. This is accomplished by collecting, preserving, interpreting and teaching Jewish values, culture and history. All of this is inspired by the dedication and courage of the Jewish people. As such, the museum desires to have an impact on behavior and promote mutual respect and understanding.
