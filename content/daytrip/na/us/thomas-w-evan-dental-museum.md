Thomas W. Evans, world-famous dentist and dentist to crowned heads of Europe, donated this land to the University of Pennsylvania on condition that they use it to found a School of Dentistry and a dental museum housing Dr. Evans' collection of dental memorabilia.

The building also features a "frieze of dental tortures".
