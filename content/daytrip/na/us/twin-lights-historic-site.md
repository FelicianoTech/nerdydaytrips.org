This is the only set of twin lighthouses in the world that are connected in the middle. From the top of the towers, it's a beautiful view of Sandy Hook, the Atlantic Ocean, and the New York City skyline from across the bay. Marconi first tested wireless communication here, the Pledge of Allegiance was recited here as our official national oath of loyalty for the first time, and on site is the very first Life Saving Service building. Lots of history and a beautiful place to stop on your way to/from the beach.
