Explore the ship that recovered the Apollo 11 astronauts. In service from World War II until the 1970s, the USS Hornet is now a museum featuring historic aircraft, other US Navy history displays, a ham radio shack, and more. Sign up for a guided tour even if you have toured that part of the ship already -- each volunteer brings their own unique knowledge and/or sea stories to the tour.
