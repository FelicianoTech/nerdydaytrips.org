Museum of Lewes' history, including maritime, military, and social. The building looks ancient but was built in 1931 in Dutch style, to honor the 300th anniversary of Delaware's first European settlement. Includes the bizarre "Zwaanendael Merman," a fake mummified "merman" similar to almost identical creatures used in sideshows and cheap museums.
