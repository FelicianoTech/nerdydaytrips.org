Note open to public every Saturday after 11am: We are a charity formed with a members society. We store, restore and exhibit not only computers, but documentation, software, artwork, history, peripherals and much more. We explore the people and organisations behind them with a focus on how they relate to Australia and/or the advancement of technology in general.
