Although the Cafe and Visitors centre are now closed and the Observatory and buildings destroyed by bushfires in 2003, ANU students use the site for modern astronomy and astrophysics study and research. The Heritage Trail (which is open daily) includes 11 interpretive signs which together provide a comprehensive history of Mount Stromlo Observatory, including the Director's Residence.
