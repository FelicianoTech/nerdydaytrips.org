The Victorian Goldfields Railway operates historic locomotives and carriages along the formerly disused branch line from Castlemaine to Maldon.

Volunteers restored the rolling stock, locomotives, and the line itself, reopening the whole branch to their collection of historic steam and diesel engines.

It is possible to take VLine train service to Castlemaine, meeting the VGR service through to Maldon. The VGR accepts bicycles (by prior booking), and so it's also possible for a confident mountain bike rider to ride the Maldon Castlemaine Trail on return, which runs alongside the rail line - and is itself a great nerdy day trip!
