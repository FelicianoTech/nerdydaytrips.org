The Great Lithgow Zig Zag first opened in 1869 as part of the Western Railway line that linked Sydney with Western New South Wales. This railway line was used to transport people and produce from the western plains of NSW to and from Sydney.

In 1910, a ten tunnel deviation was completed and the Great Lithgow Zig Zag closed and the original formation was declared as a reserve by the Crown. 60 something years later, Zig Zag Railway was born.

Many will remember Zig Zag Railway from their childhood – riding the train in the 70s, 80s or 90s. Come and relive the magic of steam trains and admire how much it has changed (and hasn’t) since you last came aboard.
