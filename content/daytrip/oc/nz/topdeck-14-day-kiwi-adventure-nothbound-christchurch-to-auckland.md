Our trip begins in quaint Christchurch, a city heroically rebuilding itself following the earthquakes of 2011. We set off to enjoy some of New Zealand’s most jaw-dropping scenery today as we drive a pass over the majestic Southern Alps. We stop in Hokitika and visit a jade factory, then on to Lake Matheson to (hopefully) see the reflection of NZ’s two highest peaks. We overnight in Fox Glacier.
