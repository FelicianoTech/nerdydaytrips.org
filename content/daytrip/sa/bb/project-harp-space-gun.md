In the 1960s a Canadian engineer named Gerald Bull had a vision of launching satellites into orbit using an enormous gun. While the project was never completed, a smaller gun about the size of a battleship's artillery was built to test suborbital flights. From its site in Barbados they got as high as 181 kilometers, well into space.

This is the rusted remains of that gun, located down on the beach near Barbados' international airport.
