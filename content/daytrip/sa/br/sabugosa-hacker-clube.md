The first (and, up to now, the only one) hackerspace in this area

Cool and tech savvy people. 

Most meetings happen during the nights and on weekends, and everyday has a different theme (Arduino, robotics, TI security, etc). But  all members have their own keys, so they can visit any time. Just drop a few lines at the mail group and they will help with your visit
