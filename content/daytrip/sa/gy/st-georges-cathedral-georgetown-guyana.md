Built largely from local timber and consecrated in 1894, this enormous Gothic church was positioned to dominate the central Georgetown skyline. Reputed to be the largest wooden church in the world, it also ranks as one of the tallest functional wooden buildings ever constructed. The imposing exterior is complemented by the stunning interior, with the Gothic forms enhanced by tropical influences. It is a marvel of construction.
