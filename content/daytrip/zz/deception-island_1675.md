Ben Goldacre (All hail the Creator) wants decaying infrastructure. This place has loads - though not strictly a day trip unless you happen to be in the Antarctic already....A decaying whaling station, next to the first place a plane ever landed on the Antarctic, if I remember properly. It's also the site of a mudslide which is why the whale station is abandoned and, if you scrape the sand underfoot for two inches it steams through the snow. Look up. Spot the volcano..... rrrrrun!
