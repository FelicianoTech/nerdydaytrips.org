Costa Rica's ultimate haunted place. This sanatorium was founded in 1915 by the renowned doctor Carlos Durán whose daughter was said to had suffered of tuberculosis, incident that motivated him to build the hospital. 

Later on it became a geriatric hospital and even a juvenile prison until its complete abandonment in 1973. 

Since then it has become the best spot in Costa Rica for those who seek the supernatural.
